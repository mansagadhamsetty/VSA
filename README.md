# VSA
Sort the given numbers or elements of an array by user based on bars and colors to differentiate their state i.e, sorted or unsorted in the sorting algorithm selected by the user and It contains a pack of 6 sorting algorithms namely Bubble, quick, merge, selection, insertion and heap sort. 

This the initial interface of the main.html, which shows all types of sorting techniques:

After choosing the algorithm, we will show the algorith steps and default time complexity of that particular algorithm:

When we go to the visualization, it will be empty at first and then we can start giving our values:

This way, the numbers are represented as the bars and ready for the sorting:

We will also warn about giving custom input like size and range of the number:

The algo starts running by changing the colors :
